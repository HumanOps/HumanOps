# HumanOps
A StackPath Movement. Focusing on the human side of running systems.


# The Problem
Overwork & constant call-outs damage health & lead to burnout

A superhero culture exists where unreasonable expectations are placed on people who operate systems. We highlight the importance of teams running systems, not just the systems themselves.


# Our Aim
Improve wellbeing. Ease communication, reduce fatigue & reduce stress

We encourage the discussion of ideas & best practices around how to look after the teams who look after your systems.


# Mantra
1. **Humans build systems. Humans are part of systems.** Well architected, modern systems are as automated & self-managing as possible, but they still require varying degrees of human operation for maintenance, upgrades & incident response. Humans are therefor an integral component of the system & proper consideration should be given to their role.
1. **Human issues are system issues.** Given humans are part of systems then human problems as a result of system operation should be considered as system problems & solved for just like technical problems.
1. **Human health is organisation health.** Organisations are made up of people. Organisations need people. If work practises produce unhealthy people then the organisation is unhealthy & this needs fixing.
1. **Humans need downtime** Unlike systems, humans need sleep & operate very poorly without it.
1. **Document. Share knowledge. Save time.** Sharing knowledge makes issues less likely to happen & easier to handle when they do. Reduce person dependency & enable others.
1. **Reduce noise. Only alert when it really matters.** Alert fatigue is human fatigue.  
1. **Automate. Escalate to a human as a last resort.** Dealing with incidents rapidly & consistently without error is best suited to machines. The system should take actions where it can to resolve problems by itself & reserve involving the humans for the edge cases as “escalations”, rather than deferring to humans by default.
1. **Learn from incidents with blameless postmortems. Don't repeat them.** Incidents will happen. Blame & shame only exacerbates problems & decreases wellbeing. They should be treated as learning opportunities to make lasting positive changes. 
1. **Improve. Prioritise reliability work.** The important work to implement stable, observable, reliable, automated systems needs to be taken seriously & regularly allocated dedicated time.


# Metrics
How do we know if we are successfully applying HumanOps principles? Many of the benefits will be qualitative e.g. better work/life balance, but others can be more quantitative:

## Human
* Better sleep (achieving sleep length targets, zero interruptions / wakeups).
* Reasonable working hours (not needing to work late, not getting called at weekends).
* Reduced stress (reduced anxiety).

## System
* Reduction in outages / incidents due to human error.
* Reduction in time to resolution (due to improved response process & incident handling).
* Reduction in alerts / incidents requiring human response.
