# HumanOps
A StackPath Movement. Focusing on the human side of running systems.


# The Problem
Overwork & constant call-outs damage health & lead to burnout.

A superhero culture exists where unreasonable expectations are placed on people who operate systems. We highlight the importance of teams running systems, not just the systems themselves.


# Our Aim
Improve wellbeing. Ease communication, reduce fatigue & reduce stress.

We encourage the discussion of ideas & best practices around how to look after the teams who look after your systems.


# Mantra
1. **Humans build systems. Humans are part of systems.** Well architected, modern systems are as automated & self-managing as possible, but they still requires varying degrees of human operation for maintenance, upgrades & incident response. Humans are therefor an integral component of the system and proper consideration should be given to their role.
1. **Human issues are system issues.** Given humans are part of systems then human problems as a result of system operation should be considered as system problems & solved for just like technical problems.
1. **Human health is organisation health.** Organisations are made up of people. Organisations need people. If work practises produce unhealthy people then the organisation is unhealthy & this needs fixing.
1. **Humans need downtime.** Unlike systems, humans need sleep & operate very poorly without it.
1. **Document. Share knowledge. Save time.** Reduce person dependency. Make life easier. Share the burden.
1. **Reduce noise. Only alert when it really matters.** 
1. **Automate. Escalate to a human as a last resort.**
1. **Learn from incidents with blameless postmortems. Don't repeat them.**
1. **Improve. Prioritise reliability work.**
